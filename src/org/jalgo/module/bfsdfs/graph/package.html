<p>The graph package provide the class ObservableGraph, the graph which BFS / DFS algorithm works on.
It also contains the class AlgoGraph, with represents the result tree for the BFS / DFS algorithm.
The both graph are observable. The observer interface for the class ObservableGraph is GraphObserver and
for the class AlgoGraph AlgoGraphObserver. Class Node and Class Edge represents the basic datatyps of the both graph.</p>
