/**
 * <p>This class can be used to compose a new animation out of existing ones.
 * Stakeholder: Animation designer...</p>
 * 
 * <p>The composition capability is obtained by subclassing <code>TimeEntity</code>.
 * In terms of the time entity, the closed real interval [0..1], which is the
 * local time domain for the animation, marks the absolute time values(!). This
 * makes it a bit hard to understand the influence of the time transformation
 * applied by <code>this</code>. Except in the rare case that you want to shift
 * or stretch the whole resulting composite animation (without changing its
 * actual duration), there will be no need nor use to change it from being
 * identity.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Use <code>addChild(TimeEntity, double, double)</code> if you want to
 * specify everything in absolute measures wrt. to the animation, not the time
 * entity (recommended). E.g. if the animation has a duration of 12, and you want
 * to add a time entity <code>t</code> at position 2 for a duration of 3, you just
 * call <code>addChild(t, 2, 3)</code>, and the <code>offset</code> and
 * <code>scale</code> of <code>t</code> will be set to 2/12 and 3/12, respectively.
 * (This example assumes that the time transformation of <code>this</code> is
 * identity.)</p>
 * 
 * <p>Naturally, to add animations to this entity, you would use
 * <code>AnimationTimeEntity</code> instances.</p>
