/**
 * <p>This interface models animations on a canvas.
 * Required canvas entities can be set up on <code>init</code>,
 * they can be disposed of in <code>done</code>,
 * and animated entities can be updated on <code>update</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Time values presented to the animation for <code>update</code>
 * are in the closed real interval [0..1]. The reason for this is that
 * the boundaries of that interval are contained in the floating point
 * domain. The animation is garuanteed to be called with these exact
 * values by the AnimationTimeEntity.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The recommended policy for implementors is as follows:
 * canvas entities needed temporarily in this animation can be created
 * in the constructor, others be passed to it. All "new" entities can
 * and should be added to the parent node on <code>init</code>, but by
 * no means before. In addition, you may assume that the animation won't
 * be used any longer after a call to <code>done</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Nothing is determined as to how the canvas entities are to be
 * created. Implementors could use some kind of context (surrounding
 * class), which would hold a reference to a canvas entity factory.
 * In most cases, temporary canvas entities are not needed and thus
 * this is no issue anyway.</p>
