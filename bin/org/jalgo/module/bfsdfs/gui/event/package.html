This package contains actions to control:
<ul>
<li>the graph (Undo, Redo, Node, Edge, DoubleEdge, Eraser)
<li>the algorithm (Reset, StepBack, StepForward, Play, Cancel)
<li>and the animations (AnimationToggleAction)
</ul>
They extend <code>AbstractAction</code> and set a name, a short description
and a small icon. It is easier controlling the actions than controlling the
buttons because there are multiple buttons for each action.
